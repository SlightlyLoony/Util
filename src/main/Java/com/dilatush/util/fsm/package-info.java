/**
 * The classes in this package implement a generic finite state machine (FSM) that can be used in real-world controllers, games, and many other
 * places.  Using an FSM generally greatly simplifies the problem, breaking it up into many small chunks of code that execute only under precisely
 * defined circumstances.  FSM-based designs are justly known for their robustness, completeness, ease of debugging, and (almost counter-intuitively)
 * their relative simplicity.  A friend of the author once described FSMs as "spaghetti-code eliminators", a description the author finds quite apt.
