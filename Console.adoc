== An Overview...
The basic idea of the console (server and client together) is to provide a way for an embedded system or daemon process to communicate with a developer or tester via something like a command line terminal.  This is analogous to using SSH to connect to a server -- except that instead of connection to the operating system's shell, you're connecting to an environment provided by code you write.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the utility of a console like this.  Suppose you're writing the code for an embedded system that has behavior that's based on time.  While you're developing and testing, it would be very useful to set the real time clock in your system to arbitrary times.  But it's an embedded system -- how are you going to "talk" to it?  That's the kind of problem this console is intended to solve.  In this example, you'd make a console server that had a command available to set the real time clock -- from the connected client, you'd type something like `setclock 12:35:50` to do it.  You might also have a command to give you the current value of the real time clock -- maybe the command `readclock` would send `12:37:44` back to you.  That's the general idea!  The console server places no restrictions on what you might do with it; it just provides the mechanism to let a console client connect with your embedded console server.  The rest is up to you.

The general structure of the console server (and client) is shown below.  The Console Client is a companion application that you can find https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/ConsoleClient[here].  The Console Server is the subject of this document, and it is an instance of the class `ConsoleServer` that runs in its own thread as a component of either an embedded system or a daemon process.  The Console Server listens on a TCP socket for network connections initiated by the Console Client.  Once the connection has been established, all the data is encrypted with a private key, using AES128 in counter mode.  If you're not familiar with that terminology, that means it's encrypted with a modern standard cipher, using a modest-sized key, and the encryption protocol is a solid one.  Authentication is implicit by the possession of the encryption key -- meaning that the Console Server and the Console Client _both_ have to have the private key, or they won't be able to connect.

== What are these utilities, anyway?
It's very hard to give a general description of these, as there are a wide variety of them.  The easiest thing to do is to browse the classes.  There are a few worth mentioning here, however:

.Notable Elements
|===
|Name|Description
|Non-Interactive Test Framework
|A test framework that allows test code to be included in production builds, while enabling and parameterization is handled via a configuration file.  This framework is intended primarily for use in embedded software and in server daemons, which share the characteristic of being non-interactive.  Look in the _test_ package for details. Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/Test.adoc[Non-Interactive Test document]
|JavaScript Configuration
|Provides a simple, flexible mechanism to write configuration files in JavaScript, via the _Nashorn_ JavaScript engine (and yes, I know it's deprecated).  See the class _AConfig_ for details.  The https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/ShedSolar[_ShedSolar_] project in my repository has a realistic example of its use.  Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/JavaScript%20Configuration.adoc[JavaScript Configuration] document.
|Command Line Argument Interpreter
|Provides everything needed for a Java command line application (or server daemon) to have Unix-style arguments.  Optional arguments can have any number of long and short names.  Passwords (and other arguments) can be entered interactively.  Parses and validates argument parameters.  Provides summary and detailed help. Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/CommandLine.adoc[Command Line document].
|Finite State Machine|Provides everything you need to build a finite state machine (FSM).  While FSMs _can_ be very complex, they can also be quite simple - and this FSM can provide the whole range.  A simple FSM can be built in a single class, as you can see with the example FSM included in the package.  This FSM package can also provide the guts of a very complex FSM, even those with nested FSMs.  Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/FSM.adoc[FSM document].

=== Some particular mentions...
==== LogFormatter
This is a formatter for the `java.util.logging` file or console logging, providing a format to the author's liking.  Of note, it supports logging thread names (instead of the standard thread IDs), and it supports logging stack traces for exceptions being logged.  It has some properties which modify its behavior:

.LogFormatter properties
|===
|*Property*|*Description*
|com.dilatush.util.LogFormatter.messageWidth|You'll be stunned to know that this property will set the message column width to something other than its default (60).
|com.dilatush.util.LogFormatter.sourceWidth|Just as amazing is this versatile property, which will set the source class column width to something other than its default (30).
|com.dilatush.util.LogFormatter.threadIDWidth|Last, but certainly not least, is this vital property, which will set the thread ID column width to something other than its default (30).

== Why does the world need these utilities?
Well, probably the world doesn't actually _need_ ShedSolar &ndash; it's mainly here for the author's personal use and enjoyment, but with some faint hope that someone else with the same challenges the author faced will also find it useful.

== Dependencies
This package has one dependency: The excellent, bog-standard Java JSON module, freely available from https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java.

== Why is this package's code so awful?
The author is a retired software and hardware engineer who did this just for fun, and who (so far, anyway) has no code reviewers to upbraid him.  Please feel free to fill in this gap!  You may contact the author at tom@dilatush.com.

== Some implementation notes...
If you dig into this package in detail, you may notice that the source code in some areas has a different style from that in other areas.  This is simply because it was written over a period of over ten years, and the author's coding style has evolved over that time.

== How is this package licensed?
Util is licensed with the quite permissive MIT license: +
