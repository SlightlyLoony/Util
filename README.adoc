== Java Utilities
A collection of Java utilities.


== What are these utilities, anyway?
It's very hard to give a general description of these, as there are a wide variety of them.  The easiest thing to do is to browse the classes.  There are a few worth mentioning here, however:

.Notable Elements
|===
|Name|Description
|Non-Interactive Test Framework
|A test framework that allows test code to be included in production builds, while enabling and parameterization is handled via a configuration file.  This framework is intended primarily for use in embedded software and in server daemons, which share the characteristic of being non-interactive.  Look in the _test_ package for details. Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/Test.adoc[Non-Interactive Test document]
|JavaScript Configuration
|Provides a simple, flexible mechanism to write configuration files in JavaScript, via the _Nashorn_ JavaScript engine (and yes, I know it's deprecated).  See the class _AConfig_ for details.  The https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/ShedSolar[_ShedSolar_] project in my repository has a realistic example of its use.  Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/JavaScript%20Configuration.adoc[JavaScript Configuration] document.
|Command Line Argument Interpreter
|Provides everything needed for a Java command line application (or server daemon) to have Unix-style arguments.  Optional arguments can have any number of long and short names.  Passwords (and other arguments) can be entered interactively.  Parses and validates argument parameters.  Provides summary and detailed help. Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/CommandLine.adoc[Command Line document].
|Finite State Machine|Provides everything you need to build a finite state machine (FSM).  While FSMs _can_ be very complex, they can also be quite simple - and this FSM can provide the whole range.  A simple FSM can be built in a single class, as you can see with the example FSM included in the package.  This FSM package can also provide the guts of a very complex FSM, even those with nested FSMs.  Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/FSM.adoc[FSM document].
|Console|Allows you to connect from a client computer (such as your development laptop) to a "console server" embedded into an embedded system or daemon process.  It's the same idea as connecting with SSH, except that instead of connecting to the operating system shell (as SSH does), you're connecting into an environment that _you_ provide, embedded right into your application.  The connection is encrypted, and mutual possession of the encryption key is the authentication.  The author needed a way that he could communicate directly with a daemon process, over the network.  This package is the generalized result of that need.  Much more in the https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/blob/master/Console.adoc[Console document].
|Info|A family of classes that let do some very nice things with information that you want to publish from one source class, but make available read-only to multiple destinations classes.  At the base of the family is the Info class, which is a generic class that simply contains a piece of immutable timestamped information (which can be an instance of _any_ class).  InfoBox instances are designed to be held privately by information sources; they contain an Info instance, which the owner can read or write.  InfoView instances are designed to be made publicly available; they contain an InfoBox instance and provide a public method to get (but not set!) the Info instance contained within the InfoBox.  As if that wasn't enough to juggle mentally, there's also a similar InfoViewerBox and ProxyInfoView pair of classes.  These provide a way for the owner of an instance of some class that publishes information with an InfoView to proxy that InfoView to user classes -- which means that the owner class can keep his source private, but publish the information from it publicly.  You can find all the info classes https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/tree/master/src/main/Java/com/dilatush/util/info[here], and a very simple example program that illustrates the uses of the info package https://github.com/SlightlyLoony/Util/tree/master/src/main/Java/com/dilatush/util/info/example[here].
|Haps|A single generic class that implements a lightweight, performant event system (a "Hap" is short for a "Happening", or an event).  The generic type for the `Haps<T>` class is an enum that you define, with one value for every Hap that you need.  Any Hap may optionally include an `Object` of any type that is the data associated with the Hap.

=== Some particular mentions...
==== LogFormatter
This is a formatter for the `java.util.logging` file or console logging, providing a format to the author's liking.  Of note, it supports logging thread names (instead of the standard thread IDs), and it supports logging stack traces for exceptions being logged.  It has some properties which modify its behavior:

.LogFormatter properties
|===
|*Property*|*Description*
|com.dilatush.util.LogFormatter.messageWidth|You'll be stunned to know that this property will set the message column width to something other than its default (60).
|com.dilatush.util.LogFormatter.sourceWidth|Just as amazing is this versatile property, which will set the source class column width to something other than its default (30).
|com.dilatush.util.LogFormatter.threadIDWidth|Last, but certainly not least, is this vital property, which will set the thread ID column width to something other than its default (30).

== Why does the world need these utilities?
Well, probably the world doesn't actually _need_ ShedSolar &ndash; it's mainly here for the author's personal use and enjoyment, but with some faint hope that someone else with the same challenges the author faced will also find it useful.

== Dependencies
This package has one dependency: The excellent, bog-standard Java JSON module, freely available from https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java.

== Why is this package's code so awful?
The author is a retired software and hardware engineer who did this just for fun, and who (so far, anyway) has no code reviewers to upbraid him.  Please feel free to fill in this gap!  You may contact the author at tom@dilatush.com.

== Some implementation notes...
If you dig into this package in detail, you may notice that the source code in some areas has a different style from that in other areas.  This is simply because it was written over a period of over ten years, and the author's coding style has evolved over that time.

== How is this package licensed?
Util is licensed with the quite permissive MIT license: +
